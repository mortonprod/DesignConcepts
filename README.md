# Design Concepts

Design concepts which can be used for many different projects.
The concepts are html and css, with a vanilla javascript on the frontend and node as the backend.

##Structure of each page

* Html built with jade.
* Initial css and animations run on startup.
* JS changes styles on each elements animation end or events from user.

##Folder structure

* Assets: Contains entry chunks and common parameters
* Designs: A folder for each design 
* Design(Example fast): Contains all information to run animations added to jade template. 

The large number of animations is split into parts; when one ends another begins.
This allows us to create sensible animation segments which can be reused.  


##Concepts

Each concept is a theme which should have consistent 

* Colour: Chose a palette and be consistent. 
* Interactions: The effect for a particular interaction should be predictable. 

The theme is the adjactive not what it is.
For example, you can make a welcome page or blog from the fast theme. 

###Fast. 

* Colour: Vibrant triad with red as primary.
* Interactions: 

Start sequence consists of 
* Letters appear slowly: "Welcome to the fast design concept" 
* Fade away letters
* Fade in: 1,2,3 
* Show motion through color change 
* Through some words(parts from websites) flying through air
* Fade to white; then show letters flashing: Now try some components?;
* Click on component to show some example components with this style.
